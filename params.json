{"name":"Gillespy","tagline":"GillesPy is a modeling toolkit for stochastic simulations of biochemical systems.","body":"#GillesPy\r\n\r\nGillesPy is a modeling toolkit for stochastic simulations for Linux and OSX. It provides a python interface to the StochKit stochastic simulation solvers. It contains a simple python interface for model construction, editing, and simulating models stochastically and deterministically.\r\n\r\nGillesPy is part of the StochSS project, see http://www.stochss.org for more details.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nGillesPy requires numpy, scipy, and matplotlib for proper functionality. Installation details for these packages can be found at http://scipy.org. \r\n\r\nGillesPy does not install the StochKit or StochKitODE solvers, but requires them for stochastic simulation. Either StochKit  **OR** StochSS must be installed to provide these solvers.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions for StochKit: http://sourceforge.net/projects/stochkit/\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions for StochSS:  http://iguana.cs.ucsb.edu/wordpress/?page_id=224\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions are provided for Linux Ubuntu and OSX.\r\n\r\n##### Ubuntu\r\n\r\nIf StochSS or StochKit is installed, GillesPy must be pointed to the solver locations. This is done during the installation, through setting a SUDO environment variable depending on whether you have StochSS or StochKit.\r\n\r\nFor StochSS, set the variable STOCHSS_HOME while in the SUDO environment. On a linux Ubuntu system, with StochSS 1.6 installed in your home directory:\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/GillesPy/gillespy.git\r\n  cd gillespy\r\n  sudo STOCHSS_HOME=$HOME/stochss.linux.1.6/ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: simply using export STOCHSS_HOME will not provide a SUDO environment variable.\r\n\r\nIf StochKit is installed, this process is similar, but instead set the environment variable STOCHKIT_HOME:\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/GillesPy/gillespy.git\r\n  cd gillespy\r\n  sudo STOCHKIT_HOME=$HOME/StochKit2.0.10/ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of this time, if only StochKit is installed, the StochKitODE solver is inaccessible.\r\n```\r\n  TODO: Provide a way to install StochKitODE.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##### OSX\r\nIf StochSS or StochKit is installed, GillesPy must be pointed to the solver locations. This is done during the installation, through setting a SUDO environment variable depending on whether you have StochSS or StochKit.\r\n\r\nFor StochSS, set the variable STOCHSS_HOME while in the SUDO environment. On OSX, if you have StochSS 1.6 installed in your Applications directory, then you would:\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/GillesPy/gillespy.git\r\n  cd gillespy\r\n  sudo STOCHSS_HOME=/Applications/StochSS-1.6/StochSSserver.app/Contents/Resources/ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### OSX (without StochSS)\r\n\r\nIf you do not have StochSS installed, you will need to download StochKit (http://sourceforge.net/projects/stochkit/) and the StochKit-ODE package from StochSS.\r\nThen set the environement variables STOCHKIT_HOME and STOCHKIT_ODE_HOME before you run the setup.py script as above.\r\n\r\nNote: simply using export STOCHSS_HOME will not provide a SUDO environment variable.\r\n\r\nIf StochKit is installed, this process is similar, but instead set the environment variable STOCHKIT_HOME:\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/GillesPy/gillespy.git\r\n  cd gillespy\r\n  sudo STOCHKIT_HOME=/Applications/StochKit2.0.10/ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of this time, if only StochKit is installed, the StochKitODE solver is inaccessible.\r\n```\r\n  TODO: Provide a way to install StochKitODE.\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
